### data dictionary
# delta.z[s] is the difference in z-scores for individual student s (immediate - delayed)
# n.students is the number of unique students
# class.index[s] is student s's class ID
# class.condition[c] is classroom c's incentive condition

### parameter dictionary
# mu.condition[i] is the mean of the distribution from which delta.z scores are drawn for students in condition i
# sigma.condition[i] is the sd of the distribution from which delta.z scores are drawn for students in condition i
