### data dictionary
# delta.z[s] is the difference in z-scores for individual student s (immediate - delayed)
# n.students is the number of unique students
# class.index[s] is student s's class ID
# class.condition[c] is classroom c's incentive condition
# n.classes is the number of unique classes
# n.metric.moderators is the number of moderating variables with metric scales
# n.nominal.moderators is the number of moderating variables with nominal scales
# y.metric[1:n.metric.moderators, c] is the vector of values of the metric moderators for classroom c
# y.nominal[1:n.nominal.moderators, c] is the vector of values of the nominal moderators for classroom c
# n.conditions is the number of unique conditions that split all the moderators (here it will be 2 for no incentive and yes incentive)
